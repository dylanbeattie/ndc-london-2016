(To the tune of Dire Straits' "Money for Nothing")

Take a look at your career, that's no way to do it,  
You're building software like it's 1993,  
That ain't working. What you got to do is,  
Get yourself a ticket to the NDC  

Come along and join the conversation,  
Rachel Reese'll talk immutability,  
Hanselman's all about the open web platform,  
Barry Dorrans' all about security,  

**CHORUS**:  
**We've to to install Microsoft Azure**    
**Continuous delivery,**  
**We're building virtual infrastructure**  
**We're hacking code on our PCs**
 
Serial Seb will solve your API problems,  
Dan North keeping it light and lean,  
Paul Stack, Ben Hall, Michele Bustamante,  
Docker containers and virtual machines  

**CHORUS**
 
**INSTRUMENTAL BREAK (guitar riff / 8 bars)**

**CHORUS**

I should have learned, some HTML  
I should have learned, some Node JS,  
Startups, burndowns, venture capital,  
Man, this business is the best,  

And Troy's up there? What's that? Australian noises?  
He's banging on your wifi like a chimpanzee,  
Oh that ain't hacking, no, that's no way to do it,  
Now get yourself a ticket to the NDC  

**CHORUS**
 
**INSTRUMENTAL BREAK (guitar riff / 8 bars)**

(spoken) 
Now that ain't learning, that's no way to do it,  
You're building software like it's 1993,  
That ain't learning, what you got to do is.  
Get yourself a ticket to the NDC
